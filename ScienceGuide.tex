\section*{Chapter 11}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Gene}
A unit of heredity which is transferred from a parent to offspring. A distinct sequence of nucleotides forming part of a chromosome, the order of which determines the order of monomers in a polypeptide which a cell may synthesize.
\item {\bf Allele}
One of two or more alternative forms of a gene that arise by mutation and are found at the same place on a chromosome.
\item {\bf Hybrid}
The offspring of crosses between parents with different traits
\item {\bf Genome}
The complete set of genes or genetic material present in a cell or organism
\item {\bf Dominant allele}
One allele of a gene is expressed even if another allele is present. The dominant allele masks the expression of the other allele.
\item {\bf Recessive allele}
This form of allele will be expressed only if the other pair is the same type. If the other pair is dominant, then the recessive will not be expressed.
\item {\bf Heterozygous}
Organisms that have two {\em different} alleles for the same trait.
\item {\bf Homozygous}
Organisms that have two {\em identical} alleles for a particular trait.
\item {\bf Principle of Dominance} If two or more forms (alleles) of
  the gene for a single trait exist, some forms of the gene may be
  dominant and others may be recessive.
\item {\bf Inheritance pattern of dominant allele}
\item {\bf Inheritance pattern of recessive allele}
\item {\bf Law of Segregation} Each adult has two copies of each
  gene. These genes are segregated from each other when gametes are
  formed.
\item {\bf Law of Independent Assortment} The alleles for different
  genes usually segregate independently of one another
\item {\bf Genotype} The genetic make-up of an organism  -  shows the
  combination of alleles (ex: PP or Pp or pp)
\item {\bf Phenotype} The characteristics or traits that show up - the
  appearance of an organism(ex: purple flower or white flower)
\item {\bf Incomplete dominance} When one allele is NOT completely
  dominant over another (they blend - pink carnations)
\item {\bf Codominance} Both alleles are expressed in the phenotype
  (black and white chicken)
\item {\bf Multiple alleles} Genes that are controlled by more than
  two alleles
\item {\bf Alleles for the blood groups (genotypes and phenotypes)}
  Three alleles for this gene
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $I^A$, $I^B$ and $i$
    \item Alleles $I^A$ and $I^B$ are codominant
    \item $i$ is recessive
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf Diploid number vs Haploid number} Haploid is Total number
  of chromosomes found in a gamete (23 for humans). Humans are diploid
  organisms, carrying two complete sets of chromosomes: one set of 23
  chromosomes from their father and one set of 23 chromosomes from
  their mother.
\item {\bf Somatic cell vs sex cell}
\item {\bf Importance of meiosis}
\item {\bf Homologous chromosomes} Homologous chromosomes are
  chromosome pairs (one from each parent) that are similar in length,
  gene position, and location. The position of the genes on each
  homologous chromosome is the same. However, the genes may contain
  different alleles.
\item {\bf Tetrad}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Each chromosome pairs with its corresponding homologous
      chromosome to form a tetrad. This process is called Synapsis.
    \item There are 4 chromatids in a tetrad.
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf Importance of crossing over}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Homologous chromosomes form a tetrad
    \item Chromatids cross over one another
    \item The crossed sections of the chromatids are exchanged.
    \item Crossing-over produces new combinations of alleles.
  \end{itemize}
  {\bf \it Understand from pictures}
\item {\bf Gamete formation in males} In male animals, meiosis results
  in four equalsized gametes called sperm. {\bf \it Understand from
    pictures}
\item {\bf Gamete formation in females} Only one egg results from
  meiosis. The other three cells, called polar bodies, are usually not
  involved in reproduction.  They give up their cytoplasm to nourish
  the 1 good egg. {\bf \it Understand from pictures}

\section*{Chapter 15}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\bf Lamarck's hypothesis of evolution} All organisms have a

    function, but not in structure.  {\em NOT EVIDENCE OF COMMON ANCESTRY
    but of evolution.}
  \item {\bf Vestigial organs} Structures that are present but
    diminished in size or function. Give evolutionary history. Long
    time ago, must have been useful.
  \item {\bf The five main points of Darwin's theory}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Individual differ, and some of this variation is heritable
    \item Offspring produce more offspring than can survive; those
      that don’t survive do not reproduce
    \item Due to limited resources, organisms compete
    \item Natural Selection: Individuals best suited to their
      environment survive and reproduce thus passing their heritable
      traits to the offspring. Others die or leave fewer
      offspring. Species change over time.
    \item Common ancestory for all species.

    fertilization likely.
  \item {\bf Zygote}
  \item {\bf Function of placenta} Connects the mother and developing
    embryo. Embryo gets its oxygen and nutrients and excretes its
    waste products. Acts as a barrier to some harmful or
    disease-causing agents. But HIV, measles can cross. Also drugs and
    alcohol can penetrate placenta.
  \item {\bf Hormones involved in child birth and milk production}

      embryos
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Chapter 40: ( No 40-1 and 40-4)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\bf Non-specific defenses}
    Defenses are designed to keep most foreign things out of the body.
  \item {\bf First line of defense}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Intact skin: Epidermis shield against invaders. Secrete
      chemicals that kill invaders. pH maintained between 3 and
      5. Acidic to prevent microbe colonization.
    \item Mucus and Cilia: Mucus is viscous fluid and traps bacteria
      and foreign particles. Hair like cilia sweeps this goop into
      throat for coughing and swallowing. Keep goop away from lungs.
    \item Saliva: Contain lysozyme to break bacterial cell wall (kill
      bacteria)
    \item Tears: Also has lysozyme
    \item Stomach Acids: Strong acids break down swallowed bacteria
  \end{itemize}
  \item {\bf Second line of defense}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Blood WBC : Attack invaders. Initiate inflammatory
        response to protect tissue. Phagocytes: Engulf and destroy
        bacteria in lysosomes.
      \item Fever: High temp means pathogen growth slowed or
        stopped. High temp increases heart rate so WBC can get to
        infection place faster.
      \item Interferon: When virus infection body releases
        interferon. Interferes with virus replication. Block synthesis
        of key proteins required for viral replication.
    \end{itemize}
  \item {\bf Antigens} Any substance, as a virus or bacterium, that
    triggers immune response. Specific Defense.
  \item {\bf Antibodies} Protein that recognizes and binds to an
    antigen.
  \item {\bf Risks of transplant} Immune system thinks transplant in
    foreign and attacks it. Makes transplants tough. Cells have marker
    proteins on surface which lets immune system recognize them. Can
    cause organ rejection.
  \item {\bf Passive Immunity} Antobodies produced by other animals
    are injected into the bloodstream. Eg. Mom passing down immunity
    to baby via breast milk or placenta.
  \item {\bf Active Immunity} You produce the antibodies - Your body
    has been exposed to the antigen in the past either by infection or
    vaccination.
  \item {\bf Allergies} Immune system mistakenly recognizes harmless
    foreign particles as serious threats.
  \item {\bf What is histamine?}  Allergens attach to mast cells. Mast
    cells in locations where external contact possible. Mast cells
    start inflammatory response. These release histamines. Histamines
    increase blood flow and fluid production in affected
    area. Sneezing, watery eyes, runny nose.
  \item {\bf Humoral immunity} Defends the body against antigens and
    pathogens in body fluids (blood and lymph) - involves mainly B
    cells. Produce antibody.
  \item {\bf Cell mediated immunity} Defends the body against abnormal
    cells and pathogens inside living cell - involves mainly T
    cells. No antibody production.
  \item {\bf Secondary immune response} When $2^{nd}$ time person
    exposed to antigen, immunological memory is triggered and immune
    system can start making antibodies immediately.
  \item {\bf Autoimmune disorder} When the immune system attacks the
    body's own cells, it produces an autoimmune disease. Thinks body's
    own cells are pathogens.
  \item {\bf Immunodeficiency disorder} Person has a weakened immune
    response. E.g. AIDs caused by HIV.
